# MinimizeNeedlessSuffering

Imagine a world where we all work together to minimize our needless suffering with a focus on measurable progress. Imagine that when we don't know how to move forward we recursively decompose our goal into subgoals until we find one small enough that we can take the next step. That's what we're doing.

Our approach differs from humanity's current approach in that we do not build random technology with little regard for the potential future consequences. We do not blindly believe that technology will solve our problems, nor do we feel powerless. Instead, we deploy or invent the technologies we need to solve the problems we have that we have identified. We understand that the universe is ours to mould and it's not going anywhere anytime soon. Our proximal focus is to minimize needless suffering, not to build rockets and AI as fast as possible, dabble in escapism or escalate an arms race. Our problems are as concrete and real as the sum of the needless mental and physical pain and suffering. We understand that if humanity does not intentionally try to make these problems go away then our problems may stick around and could get worse. We are cautiously hopeful that with patience, careful planning and action, we can have a large measurable impact. One checkbox, one word and one step at a time.
